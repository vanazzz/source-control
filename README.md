# source-control
When you are working in a collaborative environment, it is important to track the changes that you have made.
Version control allows your team members to stay updated with the work you are doing. They are able to track 
your progress if any improvements or features are added. A plus side of version control is that it eases
the process of debugging. You can revert the code back to a previous working version and figure out what
went wrong. With version control, working with hundreds of contributors is much more organized. 


Well done!
